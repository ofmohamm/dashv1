# Dash v1

A smart display that shows the time, weather, and
upcoming Outlook calendar events. Runs as a small local web page, fully on device.

## Setup

1. Start the server from this folder:

   ```bash
   python3 server.py      # Mac/Linux
   py server.py           # Windows
   ```

2. Open the dashboard in your browser:

   ```text
   http://127.0.0.1:5173/
   ```

3. Click the ✎ (edit) button in the top-right. The settings panel walks you
   through connecting your Outlook calendar, and also lets you
   set your city and pick a background.

Press `F11` (or the fullscreen button, top-right) for a clean display.

## What it does

- **Agenda** — today's upcoming events, rolling into the next days when today
  is quiet ("No more events today"). Past events drop off automatically;
  anything that doesn't fit shows as "+N more".
- **Next up** — the current or next event is marked with an accent rail and a
  live label: "Now", "Starts in 24 min", or "Next".
- **Click to join** — events with a Teams/Zoom/Meet link open it directly.
- **Always fresh** — refreshes every minute (and instantly when the screen
  wakes). If the network drops, the last agenda stays up with an
  "Offline · updated Nm ago" note.

## Run it in the background (Optional - for Windows only)

So the dashboard keeps running after you close the terminal and starts itself
when you log in:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\install-windows.ps1
```

This registers a Scheduled Task that runs the server windowlessly with
`pythonw`, restarts it if it ever stops, and launches it at every log on.
Then make a browser shortcut to `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` (or open it with
`--kiosk` for a dedicated display).

To remove it:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\uninstall-windows.ps1
```

## Notes

- Your settings are saved privately to `config.json`.
- Outlook regenerates published calendar feeds on its own schedule, so a
  brand-new event can take a while to appear.
- If nothing shows up, check `http://127.0.0.1:5173/api/events` to see the raw
  data or error.
